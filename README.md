## Does Bitcoin have a future as a recognized tender worldwide?

### Abstract:
This paper offers an in-depth analysis of bitcoins architecture and the blockchain technology which it uses to execute decentralized operations. After examining the technology, we look back on the major events which influence the development of bitcoin, its community and its price along with economic studies that give us an insight into the value of the coin. Considering the volatility and scale-ability issues reviewed in
the research provided we could say it is too early into bitcoins life cycle to say for certain if bitcoin will ever become a globally accepted tender. What we can draw from the research provided is the large amount of major companies currently accepting the tender, the growing bitcoin community that continue to put faith in the coin and the huge underworld economy operating on the dark web which uses bitcoin as its main vessel for doing business means bitcoin is strong enough to potentially develop into a worldwide tender in the future.
