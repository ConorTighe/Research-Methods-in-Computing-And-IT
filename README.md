The following is a research paper written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) on the topic of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. This repository also contains the slides from the presenation done on bitcoin as part of this module.

## Does Bitcoin have a future as a recognized tender worldwide?

### Abstract:
This paper gives a brief rundown of bitcoins internals and the blockchain on which it uses to operate. After examining the technology, we look back on the major events which influence the development of bitcoin, its community and its price along with economic studies that give us an insight into the value of the coin. The conclusion is it is too early to possibly predict if bitcoin will ever lead to it being a worldwide tender. What we can draw from the research provided is the large amount of major companies currently accepting the tender, the growing bitcoin community that continue to put faith in the coin and the huge underworld economy operating on the dark web which uses bitcoin as its main vessel for doing business means bitcoin is strong enough to potentially develop into a worldwide tender in the future.
